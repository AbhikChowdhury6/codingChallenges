## Machine Learning and Data Analysis <a name="dataml"></a>
I did some projects

### Fine-tuning LLMs for Improved Emotional Reasoning <a name="llms"></a>
We found that fine-tuning LLMs on responses from empathetic human listeners improved their performance on emotional reasoning tasks and that fine-tuning on poor listeners degraded their performance.
