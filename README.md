## Machine Learning and Data Analysis <a name="dataml"></a>
I did some projects

### Fine-tuning LLMs for Improved Emotional Reasoning <a name="llms"></a>
We found that fine-tuning LLMs on responses from empathetic human listeners improved their performance on emotional reasoning tasks and that fine-tuning on poor listeners degraded their performance.

### CPR Practice App Algorithm Development <a name="cprapp"></a>
A mobile app used to train hundreds of people on how to do hands-only CPR, my contribution being the accelerometer signal processing to derive the depth and frequency of compression.

## Talks and Awards<a name="talks"></a>
I did some projects

### Vision Hack Computer Vision Hackathon in Moscow (Russia) -  Most Innovative Award <a name="visionhack"></a>

### Bias in NLP Talk for LA Tech for Good Equity in Data Workshop Series <a name="biasinnlp"></a>
In 2021 I did a presentation on common Biases in NLP and approaches to address them for LA Tech For Good’s spring cohort.

### “DIY Wearables” Workshop Conducted at Media Lab<a name="dataengineering"></a>
I ran a workshop for the 2019 Community Biosummit at the MIT Media Lab where participants made a breathing sensor chest strap. I wrote the code for signal processing.
